[Apply Here](https://atsv7.wcn.co.uk/search_engine/jobs.cgi?owner=5041404&ownertype=fair&jcode=1875805&vt_template=965&adminview=1) (**closing date: 23 May 2021**)

I have a vacancy for a post-Masters / pre-PhD level person interested in medical image (MRI) data wrangling and analysis, including computational modelling of neurological diseases like Alzheimer's and Lewy Body Disease.

One important goal for the project is to use existing computational methods (from the [POND](http://pond.cs.ucl.ac.uk) group) to build a differential diagnosis tool for dementias, Specifically Alzheimerâ€™s Disease vs Lewy body Dementia.

This is exciting for two reasons in particular: we are looking at **real world data** from individuals **in the prodromal stage** of dementia.

If you're not quite ready for a PhD and are interested in medical image computing, this could be the role for you. The ideal candidate would have a background in computer science, physics, maths, medical image computing, or a related field.
