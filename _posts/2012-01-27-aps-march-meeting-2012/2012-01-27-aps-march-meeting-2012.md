I will present some results on dusty plasmas at this year's American Physical Society March Meeting in Boston, USA.  [My talk](http://meetings.aps.org/Meeting/MAR12/Event/165823) is scheduled for the High Pressure: Experiment session on Thursday March 1.  I'll be talking about combining Rankine-Hugoniot shock relations and target tracking to derive an equation of state for a dusty plasma.

Here is a brief video:
