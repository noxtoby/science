Today we submitted a paper on quantum filtering using a digitized weak measurement record:

"Quantum filtering one bit at a time" Jason F. Ralph and Neil P. Oxtoby (read the abstract and download from [arXiv:1108.0823](http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.0823))

Overview: The classical analogue signal originating from diffusive weak measurement of a qubit (or two) is digitized into a single bit based on its sign (+/-).  We show that such a one-bit record (OBR) can be used to purify a single- or double-qubit, both with and without feedback control.  Quantum discord and classical correlations between a pair of qubits are also very well reproduced by the OBR.

The bottom line: we have made a significant reduction in the data required to accurately reconstruct a quantum state with only minor reduction in the filter performance.
