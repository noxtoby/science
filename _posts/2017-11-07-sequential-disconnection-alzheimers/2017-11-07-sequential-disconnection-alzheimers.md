My latest paper on Alzheimer's disease progression is available in Frontiers in Neurology:

> Data Driven Sequence of Changes to Anatomical Brain Connectivity in Sporadic Alzheimer’s Disease Neil Oxtoby, Sara Garbarino, Nick Firth, Jason Warren, Jon Schott, Danny Alexander [Front. Neurol., **8**, 580 (2017)](http://doi.org/10.3389/fneur.2017.00580)

Alzheimer's disease is thought to be a "disconnection syndrome", where brain regions becomes increasingly disconnected due to [neurodegeneration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neurodegeneration). No-one has examined the sequence of changes in the elderly brain's anatomical connectivity over the course of a neurodegenerative disease.

Until now.

In this paper, I analysed brain imaging data (MRI) to build [connectomes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectome) for healthy and diseased individuals from the public [ADNI](http://adni.loni.usc.edu) dataset, and summarised brain connectivity in health and disease using [graph theory metrics](http://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/measures/list).

These metrics were then plugged into our ever-reliable [event-based model](http://neiloxtoby.com/work/2014/08/event-based-model-of-alzheimers-disease/) of disease progression (with an important tweak courtesy of [Nick](http://twitter.com/Piman314)) in order to find the sequence of brain disconnections due to Alzheimer's disease. The paper was published on 7 Nov 2017.
