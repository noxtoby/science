Working with folk from my old stomping ground at the University of Liverpool, we discovered in the laboratory that a two-dimensional dusty plasma can be adequately described using the ideal gas law - even when shock waves are excited to melt the dust crystal.

The title and abstract are below, but you can read all about it in Physical Review Letters via [DOI 10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.015002](http://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.015002 "Ideal Gas Behavior of a Strongly Coupled Complex (Dusty) Plasma")Â (or for free at [arXiv:1212.1209](http://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1209 "Same content as the published version")).

### Ideal Gas Behavior of a Strongly Coupled Complex (Dusty) Plasma

#### N.P. Oxtoby, E.J. Griffith, C. Durniak, J.F. Ralph, and D. Samsonov

In a laboratory, a two-dimensional complex (dusty) plasma consists of a low-density ionized gas containing a confined suspension of Yukawa-coupled plastic microspheres. For an initial crystal-like form, we report ideal gas behaviour in this strongly coupled system during shock-wave experiments. This evidence supports the use of the ideal gas law as the equation of state for soft crystals such as those formed by dusty plasmas.
