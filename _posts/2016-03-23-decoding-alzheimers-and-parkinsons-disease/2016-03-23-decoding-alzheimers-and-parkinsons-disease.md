Following a press-release today (23 March 2016), Dr. Laura Phipps from Alzheimer's Research UK wrote a blog post about my research into Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Check it out: [www.dementiablog.org/using-computers-to-decode-alzheimers](http://www.dementiablog.org/using-computers-to-decode-alzheimers)

The official project description can be found [here](http://www.alz.org/research/alzheimers_grants/for_researchers/overview-2016.asp?grants=2016oxtoby).
