I recently visited Garmisch-Partenkirchen to participate in the [6th annual International Conference on the Physics of Dusty Plasmas](http://www.icpdp2011.de).  The conference was excellent.  Full of very interesting talks and a decent social program, too.  See photos below.

I presented a poster at the conference, entitled "Tracking Compressed Dust".  This extended my work on accurate determination/estimation of the physics of dusty plasma crystals and liquids.

Contact me for the PDF of my poster, or for more details on my work on state estimation and tracking in dusty plasmas.

Tschüss!
