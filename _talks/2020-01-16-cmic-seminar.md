Thanks to colleagues in the UCL [Centre for Medical Image Computing](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/cmic) (CMIC) and [Dementia Research Centre](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/drc/) for turning out in force yesterday for my CMIC seminar (15 January 2020).

Looking forward to following up with new results as they come in now that my UKRI Future Leaders Fellowship has started!
