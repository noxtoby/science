**Update! We published a paper on the workshop content: [Davenport et al., Journal of The Royal Society Interface (2023)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rsif.2022.0406).**

Many thanks to the organisers of the [Rosetrees interdisciplinary workshop on neurodegenerative diseases of the brain](https://www.physicsoflife.org.uk/neurodegenerative-disease.html#) yesterday (10 Feb, via Zoom).

I had a great time presenting my talk and discussing the physics of life, plus our work on disease progression modelling in the [UCL POND](http://pond.cs.ucl.ac.uk) group.

My slides are here:  
[Top-down and Bottom-up models of neurodegenerative disease progression](http://neiloxtoby.com/work/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/20210210-PhysicsOfLife_ND-Oxtoby.pdf)

The recording of my talk is up on YouTube:
