I was invited to present today to the NeuroImaging Statistics Oxford ([NISOx](http://www.nisox.org)) reading group of Prof Thomas Nichols at the [Oxford Big Data Institute](https://www.bdi.ox.ac.uk).

I ended up giving two talks after my first talk (on [TADPOLE Challenge](https://tadpole.grand-challenge.org)) generated some interest in the event-based model!

Here are the slides:
