Thanks to folks in the UCL MRC Unit for Lifelong Health and Ageing (and colleagues beyond) for hosting me for a Zoom seminar today (13 May 2020).

I very much appreciate the questions, discussion, and enthusiasm for my research.

Special thanks to [Sarah-Naomi James](https://twitter.com/sarah_naomi_1) for inviting me!
