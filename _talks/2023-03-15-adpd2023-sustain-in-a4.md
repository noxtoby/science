*"Disease Progression Modelling on MRI data Identifies Subtypes with Cognitive Heterogeneity in A4 Study Preclinical Trial Cohort"*

**TL;DR:** We used SuStaIn to find MRI-based subtypes in the screening data of the A4 Study clinical trial (preclinical Alzheimerâ€™s disease) and leveraged the ADNI observational dataset to link these subtypes to heterogeneous cognitive decline.

This could potentially wash out any treatment effect (if present) in the A4 study trial. This work was completed before the results of A4 were known.
