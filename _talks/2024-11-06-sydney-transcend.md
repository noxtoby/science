As part of our [TranSCEND](https://ucl-usyd-transcend.github.io) project, and in collaboration with the [Sydney Clinical Imaging Network](https://www.sydney.edu.au/medicine-health/our-research/research-networks/sydney-clinical-imaging-network.html), Elie Matar and I co-organised the "[Cutting edge tools for unravelling neurodegenerative disease]()" symposium and workshop at the University of Sydney in November 2024.

I gave the opening keynote.

Absolutely loved going to Sydney for this. Met many excellent scientists and cool people.
