Dominantly-inherited Alzheimer&apos;s disease is widely hoped to hold the key to developing interventions for sporadic late onset Alzheimer&apos;s disease. We use emerging techniques in generative data-driven disease progression modelling to characterize dominantly-inherited Alzheimer&apos;s disease progression with unprecedented resolution, and without relying upon familial estimates of years until symptom onset.
